When we analyze algorithms in computing, we often talk about their complexity and how they will scale.
Complexity is a way of expressing the number of steps or operations in an algorithm. 
And the reason is an important is that it gives us an idea of how long it will take the algorithm to execute. 
Of course, we expect an algorithm to take longer if the input to the algorithm gets bigger. 
But how much longer? Complexity is therefore typically expressed as a function of the number of elements in the input data.
Let's think about the two algorithms we've seen so far. Finding the maximum value in a collection, and determining whether a collection contains some value. 
In both cases, the operation we care about is the comparison between numbers, because that's what we're really doing here, making a bunch of comparisons. 
So let's measure the number of comparisons for these two algorithms, and understand it as a function of the input size.
